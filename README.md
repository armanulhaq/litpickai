For production see the vercel.json rewrite rules.

## üß† How It Works

1. **Genre Selection:**
   Users pick a genre (e.g., Fiction, Science) from the moods page.

2. **Book List:**
   The app fetches the latest NYT bestsellers for that genre via a proxied API request.

3. **Book Details:**
   Clicking a book fetches detailed info and sends it to Google Gemini, which returns:

    - A summary
    - Why you'll love it
    - Target audience
    - Author background

4. **AI Display:**
   The AI response is parsed and beautifully displayed, giving users a unique, engaging experience.
